Prediction of a wind turbine generated power for a Kaggle competition 

This code provides some feature engineering techniques I use for wind speed data. Wind speed data are very hard to deal with since they have a non-linear presence. 
There are different techniques someone can use to smooth the signals of the data or reform them so you can extract some very pivotal information for your models.
